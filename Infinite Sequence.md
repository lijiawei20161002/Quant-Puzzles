### Solution

At first glance, this problem may seem challenging, but a straightforward analysis leads to an elegant solution.

From the original equation:
\[
x^{x^{x^{x^{x}}}} = 2
\]

We observe that the infinite sequence implies:
\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} x^{x^{x^{\dots}}} = 2
\]

This means that the sequence converges to 2, regardless of the number of terms in the exponentiation. Hence, the following equality holds:
\[
x^{x^{x^{x^{\dots}}}} = x^{2}
\]

Thus, the equation simplifies to:
\[
x^2 = 2
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we find:
\[
x = \sqrt{2}
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
x = \sqrt{2}
\]
